In this app, I used the React Router.
This app mainly consist of three component.

- **App Component**: Consists of 3 routes .i.e home, /add_note and /edit_note
- **AddNote**: This component consist of a editable section and a button. And I used this component for Add Note and Edit Note and to implement the particular functionality for adding and editing note I restricted in some way.
- **Snippet**: This component is for note which consist of note and editable button.
